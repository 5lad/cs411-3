## CS 411 - User Stories Description

As the page loaded, users have two options of either login with their account or use the site as a guest. By logging in, they will have their data and settings from previous sessions readily available. As the users get to the next page, they can either upload a new picture or, if they're logged in, use one of their previously uploaded photos. With previous photos, the site displays the cached results from that session.  With uploading new photos, users have an option to indicate that whether the photo is of themselves or someone else's. If it's someone else's, the site only shows buying selections with the gift wrapping option. Besides that, the site's uploading process also guides the users through picking the type of photos that would generate the most accurate result. As the photo uploaded, the site processes and shows the kind of glasses that best fit the face in the photo. If the site found nothing, it indicates that to the users and recommends some generic and fit-all type of classes.
