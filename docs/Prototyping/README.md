## CS 411 - Prototyping

We chose to use Flask as the back-end framework for our projectâ€™s prototype. There are two reasons for that: One for the language choice and the other for the framework choice.

The first reason is that we wanted to use Python as our development language because, as compared to other languages like PHP, it has the best library support. This is especially important for us as we are planning on using Machine Learning in our web application (to train our back-end algorithm to match face types with glasses types), and on utilizing Python libraries like TensorFlow and Scikit Learn for that purpose.

Our main considerations for the web framework for Python were Flask and Django. In the end, we decided to go with Flask because of its higher flexibility when it comes to choosing which databases and which database abstraction layers to use. In addition, for those of us who had not had prior back-end programming experience, we thought that Flask would provide better learning opportunities than Django would, by giving us more room to play around with different architecture components.
